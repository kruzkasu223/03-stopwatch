# 03/27-stopwatch

This project is all about building a custom stopwatch from the ground up. Will only be creating functionality of stopwatch, not focusing on design.

I will use [React](https://reactjs.org/) with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [vite bundler](https://vitejs.dev/).
